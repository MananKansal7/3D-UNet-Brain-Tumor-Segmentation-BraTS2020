# Brain Tumor Segmentation Using 3D U-Net (BraTS 2020)

This repository contains a deep learning project that uses a 3D U-Net architecture with Spatial Attention and SpatialDropout3D for segmenting brain tumors from MRI scans. The model is trained on the BraTS 2020 dataset.

---

## Overview

Brain tumor segmentation is a critical step in medical image analysis. This project enhances the basic 3D U-Net by integrating spatial attention and dropout to improve focus on important tumor regions and reduce overfitting.

## Results

Example Dice scores for different tumor classes:

| Tumor Class       | Dice Score |
|-------------------|------------|
| Necrotic/Core     | 0.87       |
| Edema             | 0.91       |
| Enhancing Tumor   | 0.89       |
